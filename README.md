# Rusty Panther 🐈⚙

Rusty Panther is a widget-based terminal GUI crate. It aims to make beautiful, functional terminal GUIs, while maintaing simplicity to free developers' minds to focus on more important things. The name was inspired by my black cat, who, in addition to being beautiful 🐈, likes us to serve her such that she saves maximum effort in life.

## Not yet ready for production

This crate is not ready to be used in production yet, but keep an eye out; I'll be actively developing here, and I hope to get a lot done! If you want to contact me about any features or features-to-be, feel free to open a discussion! I'll almost positively get back to you in 48 hours.

## Dependencies

This crate (so far) has only one dependency: [Termion](https://github.com/redox-os/termion).
